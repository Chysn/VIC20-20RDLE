20RDLE is a 5-letter puzzle game for Commodore VIC-20, inspired by WORDLE. It
requires 24K of memory expansion in your VIC-20. To start 20RDLE:

    LOAD "20RDLE",8
    RUN

You have six guesses to find the 5-letter word that your VIC-20 is thinking of.

Enter a 5-letter word in the matrix. Press DEL to go back, and RETURN to submit 
your guess. You may also press F1 to restart the game with a new word.

If your guess isn't in the 9000-entry word dictionary, the screen border will
flash yellow, and the guess will not be evaluated. Try another word. A real one!

20RDLE will highlight letters in the puzzle. Letters in the right place will be
highlighted  green, and letters that are in the puzzle, but in the wrong place, 
will be highlighted yellow.

If you figure out the word with six guesses or less, you WIN, and the border
will turn green.

If you don't figure out the word, you LOSE, and the border will turn red, and
the word will be revealed.

To start a new game, press any key.
